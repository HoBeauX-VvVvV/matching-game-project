Name: Music Matching Cards-a musical instrument themed card matching game, a pair of cards is selected by the user and checked for a match, 
a correct match removes the cards, an incorrect guess returns the cards, points are scored accordingly.

I chose this game because I though it would be challenging enough without being more that I could complete. 
I was hoping I would have more time for styling but I was unable to implement 
images onto the cards and that used up the bulk of the time I would have spent styling.

Attributions:
I used a few sound files: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/
and a background image linked in the CSS file
I have instrument images chosen but they are not implemented yet.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Next steps: If I was able to impliment images instead of words on the cards for matching I would be very happy with my achievement. 
Something I think would be a fun challenge would be to make the size of the came board selectable 
at the start of the game (20 cards, 25 cards, 30 cards ect..) while using the same logic framework.
